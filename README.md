# Purpose of This Thorn

This thorn is a port of the [Multipole](https://bitbucket.org/einsteintoolkit/einsteinanalysis/src/master/Multipole/) by Ian Hinder and Andrew Knapp.

The Multipole thorn performs spherical harmonic mode decomposition of Cactus grid functions on coordinate spheres.  It can decompose multiple grid functions with any spin-weight on multiple spheres. 

This thorn uses the Cactus interpolator interface to access grid functions, so works with mesh-refinement and multi-patch.
